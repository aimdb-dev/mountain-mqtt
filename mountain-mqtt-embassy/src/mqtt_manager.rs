/// Run MQTT activities using the provided stack and settings.
/// This uses [Client], but via [embassy_sync::channel::Channel]s for use
/// from embassy.
///
/// It implements the following additional features compared to [Client]:
///
/// 1. When an error is encountered, the current [mountain_mqtt::packet_client::Connection] and [Client] are dropped, and a new connection/client made.
/// 2. [mountain_mqtt::packets::pingreq::Pingreq]s will automatically be sent to keep the connection alive, and if the server does not send acknowledgements for more than a timeout interval, the connection/client will be dropped and reconnected.
///
/// An [MqttEvent] is sent to `event_sender` whenever a relevant event occurs;
/// this will be either a connection, a disconnection, or receiving
/// an [ApplicationMessage]. When an [ApplicationMessage] is received, it is
/// converted into an `E` to be sent, allowing the use of application-specific
/// events.
///
/// Each time a new connection is made, it is assigned a [ConnectionId], and
/// each [MqttEvent] has an associated [ConnectionId] (including the events on
/// connecting and disconnecting).
///
/// While a connection is active, actions will be pulled from `action_receiver`,
/// and the [MqttOperations] trait will be used to allow each action to perform operations
/// on the active MQTT [Client]. The [MqttOperations] trait provides the current
/// [ConnectionId], so it is possible to tie actions to a specific connection.
/// So if an action is specific to a given connection and is called with a
/// different current [ConnectionId], it can just skip any operations it would
/// perform on the [Client] - this is useful for actions that subscribe to
/// topics in response to a new connection.
/// A similar approach is used for retrying operations - if an operation fails,
/// it will be called again on reconnection, with `is_retry` set to true, and
/// can then decide whether to retry operations on the client, or just skip.
///
/// This approach doesn't cover all possible sequences of operations, but
/// should cover a lot of common use cases, via something like the following
/// usage:
///
/// 1. Set up your network stack, define [Settings] and [ConnectionSettings], and create [embassy_sync::channel::Channel]s for events and actions.
/// 2. Make a new task to call this function, and start the task.
/// 3. Start feeding actions to the action channel, and receiving events on the event channel.
///
/// In most cases, you will want to respond to an [MqttEvent::Connected] event
/// by sending actions to subscribe to relevant topics (if any), including the
/// [ConnectionId] from the event in the action and checking this against the
/// current [ConnectionId] provided when [MqttOperations::perform] is called.
/// By specifying the id, we ensure that if the connection is closed before
/// the actions are handled, they will be ignored - each connection will get
/// its own set of subscription actions, to avoid performing extra subscriptions etc.
///
/// In many cases, you can send actions that result in publishing messages
/// without a [ConnectionId], and they can then publish to the [Client] ignoring
/// the current [ConnectionId].
///
/// This function uses type parameters to allow it to work with
/// application-specific types and data sizes:
///
/// - `A` for the action type used to perform operations on the MQTT server
/// - `E` for the event type produced from [ApplicationMessage]s received from the MQTT server.
/// - `P` for the maximum property size expected in sent and received MQTT packets.
/// - `B` for the size of buffers used for network receive and transmit, and for processing MQTT packets.
/// - `Q` for the size of the channels used for events and actions.
///
/// Generally you will want to call this function as an embassy task - since it
/// contains type parameters it can't be used directly, so you can just wrap it
/// in another function that specifies the type parameters directly, e.g.:
///
